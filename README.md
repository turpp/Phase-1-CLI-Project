The Movie Selector is a CLI Application that is design to allow a user to quickly view and find out more information on movies from TMDB. 

This application uses an API from TMDB to get all the information. The application sorts the Movies in 3 different ways.
 1. by popularity according to number of votes on TMDB.
 2. By genre. Allows the user to select the genre they are in the mood for and view movies that are in that genre.
 3. By rating. This sorts the movies by average vote score from TMDB. 

The user also has the ability to view and add movies to a watch list. 

To use the application follow the one screen prompts.
